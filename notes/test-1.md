# This is a test note (1)

## Subtitle

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

### Even more subtitle

This is just a test to see how many lines I can add without making it too long or confusing. Here we go...

**Bold text**

This should show up as bold text. Let's try some more...

*Italic text*

And this should be italicized. Okay, so far so good...

~~Strikethrough text~~

I hope this strikethrough business works as expected...

### Another subtitle

More testing going on here...

![](https://www.placehold.it/300x250)

A link to an image placeholder, just for kicks.

> Blockquote time!

This should be a blockquote. Let's see how it turns out...

> > Nested blockquotes!
>
> > And even more nested ones!

### Yet another subtitle

I hope this is all good so far. Let me know if you need anything else...

++Header with plus signs++

This should show up as a header, right?

++ Another one with plus signs++
++ And another one after that!!

### The very last subtitle

And finally... more testing!

* [Link](https://www.placehold.it) *

A link to an image placeholder. Yeah, I know...

**More bold text**

Just in case we need some extra boldness around here...

```python
for i in range(10):
    print(i)
```
